# Who am I?

Hello! I'm Ignacio, a master's student who enjoys doing Data Analysis and who has a passion for MotoGP (and motorsport in general). I've always been fascinated by the world of motor racing and the insights that data can bring to it. In fact, I'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to data, enjoying loking and analyzing data for hours aboutn topics I'm interested in.

## My Skills and Experience

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate with experience in a variety of programming languages. While I have a good grasp of Python and can handle data analysis libraries decently, my studies in Computer Engineering have given me the opportunity to program in many other languages and paradigms. This diverse experience has equipped me with a broad understanding of different approaches to problem-solving in the field of software development.

In the realm of data analysis, particularly in the context of MotoGP, I've been able to apply my Python skills and familiarity with data analysis libraries to uncover interesting trends and insights. While I'm still honing my skills in this area, I'm excited about the potential of data analysis in transforming our understanding of MotoGP.

## My Methodology

I conduct my analyses using Python in a separate repository. My analyses involve a variety of techniques, including statistical analysis, predictive modeling (which is why I'm studying a master's in Big Data anbd Advanced Analytics), and data visualization, to uncover patterns, trends and insights in the world of MotoGP data.


## My Goals

With this site, I aim to share my passion for MotoGP and data analysis with others. I hope to provide valuable insights into the world of MotoGP and demonstrate the power of data analysis. Besides, I really enjoy doing analysis and what harm could I do by sharing them?

## Other Projects

One of my notable projects is the development of the [Database Editor for F1 Manager 23](https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor). This tool has significantly enhanced the gaming experience for the community. As the developer, I've been able to leverage my technical skills to create a tool that not only meets the needs of the players but also improves their interaction with the game.

## Contact Me

If you have any questions or are interested in my work, feel free to contact me. I'm always open to discussing MotoGP, data analysis, or potential collaborations.

Thank you for visiting my site!
