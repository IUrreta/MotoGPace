The Qatar Grand Prix has once again lit up the MotoGP calendar, offering a wealth of data to dissect the evolving dynamics of this season's competitors. In the following analysis, we'll dive into the intricacies of the race, evaluating individual performances and the tactical decisions that shaped the podium. We'll look at who exceeded expectations, who struggled to find their rhythm, and how the results from Losail International Circuit could influence the battles in the races to come. Let's gear up for an in-depth exploration of the Qatar GP's twists, turns, and what they herald for the future of this thrilling championship.

We'd normalyy start by taking a look at what happened in Friday to see if it could have given us some insights on what we would see later on saturday and sunday. Unfortunately, this year the weather gods decided that it was time to give us **RAIN** in **Qatar**. This is an issue for data analysts because on FP1 the riders and teams were getting up to speed again and testing the track after the WEC hosted a race there the poreious week, and in the second session (that should have been PR but was changed into FP2) the rain hit the track meaning there were no real quali or race simulations. So we'll move on to *saturday*.

## SATURDAY

Starting with the Practice session held in Satrurday (which would determine the 10 riders that would go directly into Q2),

**How to read:** Graph is ordered by **BEST** laps. **IDEAL** laps are the combination of a rider's best 4 sectors , no matter if they were achieved in differnet laps or runs. The stripped area is the potential improvment of each rider's best lap compared to their ideal lap (basically, the difference between the best lap that they put together in the session and their best 4 sectors together).
