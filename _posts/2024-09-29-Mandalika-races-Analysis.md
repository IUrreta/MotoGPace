## Sprint: Not again, Jorge

Yesterday's sprint race was marked by a costly mistake from Jorge Martín, continuing a pattern we've seen throughout the season where both he and Pecco Bagnaia push each other so hard that they sometimes struggle to keep the bike on track. Despite his crash, Martín’s pace during the initial laps (1-5) and again from laps 8-13 was nothing short of remarkable, as he made quick work of cutting through the field. His aggressive style and speed showed that, had it not been for the error, he could have been in serious contention for the top spot. All signs pointed to him being a strong contender in today’s long race.

Pecco Bagnaia, during his post-sprint interviews, mentioned that as soon as he saw Martín go down, he knew he needed to change his approach. He pushed hard in the first three sectors of each lap, while holding back a little in the final sector to avoid unnecessary risks. This was a clear response to the tricky track conditions, which had proven difficult for many riders. The data shows how this strategy played out, with Pecco deliberately losing time in sector 4. It was a masterclass in adaptation, but as he mentioned, such a strategy was unlikely to work in the longer race on Sunday, where the stakes and challenges were much greater.

## Race: Not again indeed, Jorge

In today’s long race, Martín’s performance was a model of consistency. Although he didn’t reach the explosive peaks in lap times that riders like Enea Bastianini or Pecco Bagnaia showed at certain points, his strength lay in maintaining a steady, solid pace. Crucially, Martín had an excellent start, which allowed him to get into clean air early on and avoid much of the chaos behind him.

This clean running helped him control the race from the front. In contrast, Bagnaia had a disastrous start, which significantly hampered his race as he found himself mired in the midfield, struggling to make progress early on.

The race turned into a battle of survival, with only 12 riders making it to the finish line. Both Marc Márquez and Enea Bastianini faced major setbacks—Márquez suffered a heartbreaking engine failure, and Bastianini crashed out while chasing Pedro Acosta. These incidents have essentially ended their chances in the championship fight.

With both riders now depending on a string of mistakes from Martín and Bagnaia, their hopes are slim. Bagnaia, despite his early struggles and difficulties overtaking, managed to salvage a podium finish. He spent most of the race in sixth place, seemingly stuck, but persistence paid off in the end, securing valuable points that could be crucial for his title defense.

Pedro Acosta had an outstanding race, proving once again why he’s one of the most promising talents in MotoGP. His pace throughout the race was strong, and although there was some concern about a potential issue with the front tire pressure, it turned out to be a sensor malfunction. This ensures that Acosta retains his well-earned podium finish, marking another impressive milestone in his career.

Fabio Quartararo also had a mixed day—despite a strong qualifying performance and a decent result by the end of the race, he struggled significantly in the opening laps. While there were some signs of improvement from the Japanese manufacturers this weekend, particularly with Quartararo and Johann Zarco showing glimpses of competitiveness, the overall pace remains a concern. On the other hand, the performances of Joan Mir and Álex Rins were quite disappointing, highlighting the inconsistency that continues to plague the Japanese bikes. Despite these small steps forward, they still seem far from being able to consistently challenge, even the midfield.
