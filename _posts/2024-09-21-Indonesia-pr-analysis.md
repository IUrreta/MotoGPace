The first (and last) non-free practice session of the MotoGP weekend provided plenty of insights into the riders’ race preparations, with a mix of long runs, time attacks, and tire management strategies shaping the early picture. As the grid gears up for a crucial race weekend, standout performances came from the likes of Marco Bezzecchi and Marc Márquez, who showcased impressive consistency on soft tires. Meanwhile, Jorge Martín and Enea Bastianini positioned themselves as key contenders for both race pace and qualifying, each displaying their strengths across different stints. With the track conditions at Mandalika proving particularly demanding on tires, setup choices and tire conservation are set to play a pivotal role as the weekend progresses.

## Long runs: Is Bezzecchi cooking?

**Info:** Long runs are considered stints with **at least** 5 laps excluding the pit exit and pit entry laps. The runs are ordered by the **meidan** lap.

Both Marco Bezzecchi and Marc Márquez delivered impressive long runs using soft tires, both at the front and rear. Bezzecchi's performance stood out particularly, as he completed a significant stint with a front tire that had already clocked 16 laps. His ability to maintain consistency with that level of tire wear is remarkable. Márquez also showed strong pace with a similar tire setup.

While Pedro Acosta demonstrated a solid race pace, the most representative performance in terms of race conditions came from Jorge Martín. Martín's long run with a medium front tire and a hard rear was especially convincing, suggesting that his setup may be well-suited for the demands of the race. Enea Bastianini also displayed good pace, though his long run fell just short of Martín’s performance.

As for Francesco Bagnaia, his long-run pace was not particularly outstanding. However, based on his history in 2022 and 2023, we can expect Bagnaia to take a significant step forward between Friday and Saturday. He has often used these early sessions to gather data and make substantial improvements as the weekend progresses.

## Time attacks: Bastianini advantage

The comparison between the fastest sectors and the analysis of optimal lap times vs. best lap times highlights that Enea Bastianini is currently the strongest rider over a single lap. His short-run performance has been solid, showcasing his potential for qualifying. However, Jorge Martín’s second time attack attempt did not bring any improvement, which suggests he might have more in reserve for the upcoming sessions.

Bagnaia, on the other hand, struggled initially in the short-run simulations. But during his last outing, he managed to recover significantly. His earlier difficulties were so pronounced that Ducati likely ran the bike with the bare minimum amount of fuel during his final attempt, leading to the notable scene where Marc Márquez gave him a ride back to the pits at the end of the session.

Meanwhile, Maverick Viñales showed promising signs after Aprilia’s recent struggles in previous races. With some time still on hand to display, and maybe a bit more steps on saturday morning, he could be in for solid points this weekend. 

Notably, the Japanese manufacturers made a significant leap forward during the short runs, with Fabio Quartararo securing a spot in Q2. Quartararo’s aggressive style and sheer determination—despite the limitations of his Yamaha—continue to impress, as he consistently pushes beyond the bike's current capabilities. Luca Marini, Johann Zarco, and Álex Rins also came close to breaking into Q2, underscoring the steady improvements from both Yamaha and Honda. However, Takaaki Nakagami and Joan Mir are still struggling to find pace. In particular, Mir, from which I expect more personally, being a world champion.


## Extra: top speeds

As shown in the top 10 speed charts by bike, KTM currently has the fastest machine on the straight. However, Mandalika is a track that places heavy demands on tire management. If a team can maintain a significant tire life advantage towards the end of the race, overtaking opportunities should arise, even against the higher top-speed bikes.

Given this, KTM might benefit from adjusting their setup slightly, perhaps adding more load to the bike, sacrificing some straight-line speed to improve cornering performance. So far, with the exception of Pedro Acosta, KTM’s performance has been somewhat disappointing, and this adjustment could help them gain the balance they need for a better race performance.
