As some teams hasve started presenting their new lineups for the 2024 season, I though what better time to compare some of the riders to their teammates last season to throw a bit of insight on how it **actually** went down to both of them during the 2023 campaign.

So, as of today, 25th of January, we've had Gresini, Ducati Lenovo and VR46 team presentations, so the teammates pairings I have done research for are:
- Pecco Bagnaia and Enea Bastianini (both Ducati Lenovo)
- Alex Marquez and Fabio Di Giannantonio (one Gresini and one VR46)
- Marc Marquez and Joan Mir (one Gresini and one Repsol Honda)
- Marco Bezzechi and Luca Marini (one VR46 and one Repsol Honda)

We'll start for the Gresini pairing from last year: Alex Marquez and Fabio Di Giannantonio:
While we know that DiGia made a huge step forward at the end of the season when his ride was at a serious risk and it even looked gone for him, the rest of the season was pretty rough on him. Alex Marquez absolutely obliterated DiGia up until september when rumors started flying around Marc Marquez joining Gresini, and although the difference in the championship standings was only of 26 points (less than one full weekend of difference counting Sprint Points), throught the year Alex Marque was clearly the fastest driver.
