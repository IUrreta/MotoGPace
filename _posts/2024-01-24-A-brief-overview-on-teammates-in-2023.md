As some teams hasve started presenting their new lineups for the 2024 season, I though what better time to compare some of the riders to their teammates last season to throw a bit of insight on how it **actually** went down to both of them during the 2023 campaign.

So, as of today, 25th of January, we've had Gresini, Ducati Lenovo and VR46 team presentations, so the teammates pairings I have done research for are:
- Pecco Bagnaia and Enea Bastianini (both Ducati Lenovo)
- Alex Marquez and Fabio Di Giannantonio (one Gresini and one VR46)
- Marc Marquez and Joan Mir (one Gresini and one Repsol Honda)
- Marco Bezzechi and Luca Marini (one VR46 and one Repsol Honda)

The method used for all of these comparisons will be the same: find the difference between both of them in race pace, only counting races where both of them have completed at least 5 laps. This means that, for example, in the graph comparing the Repsol Honda riders there will be a lot of gaps due to their amount of crashed and injuries.

### Alex Marquez vs Fabio Di Giannantonio

As it can be seen in the graph, up until the race in San Marino, Di Giannantonio had better race pace only in the sprint race in Le Mans. This means that  Di Giannantonio was slower than Alex in 17 out of the first 18  that both riders took part in (only counting races where both of them did more than 5 laps).
Of course it is very clear from the graph that in the last 2 Grand Prix DiGia was faster than Alex, securing even a win in the main race in Qatar and a brilliant second place at the season finale in Valencia, thus getting one more feature race wins than his teammate.  But this strong end to the season can't fix everything that has been Di Giannantonio before in MotoGP, specially in 2023, his second season in the category, where in average he was almost 0.7% slower than his teammate during all the season.
