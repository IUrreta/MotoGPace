In the past three years, MotoGP has seen a variety of races and changes in team dynamics. This article provides a detailed analysis of the qualifying performances of MotoGP teams during this time. It aims to highlight their strategies and performance levels, and identify areas for improvement. The analysis will include pattern recognition, team comparisons, and an exploration of the factors that have influenced the current state of MotoGP.

**Info:** For this analysis I have calculated the average gap in terms of % to pole position for the fastest bike for each team. Only dry sessions data has been used to do the analysis

## 2023 Qualifying: Ducati is king

Starting by taking a look into the **2023** season which introduced sprint races, meaning that qualifyings took place in the saturday morning of each Grand Prix in stead of at lunch time as it had been the case for the time before.

Straight away looking at the top of the chart there are no surprises as the 3 fastest teams this season are Ducati teams. One interesting thing is that the Mooney VR46 team was actually **faster** than the Prima Pramac Racing despite their riders using the old **GP22** in comparison with the new **GP23** that Martin and Zarco used this year. Still, this is a very close top 3 (in fact, the closest in the last 3 years! Only 0.297%!)

Other worth noticing situations are Gresini being the worst Ducati team but still being only 0.5% off on average from pole, and even behind the official KTM team which has made a big step forward when comparing this season to 2022 and 2021 and are 0.45% off pole and very close to Aprilia.

In the bottom half of the graph we can find mainly japaneese constructors confirming their downfall since Quartararo's title in 2021. Repsol Honda has pretty much stayed the most consistant through these 3 years being always mid-pack, but both LCR Honda (1.6% off pole!) and the official Yamaha (0.8% off pole) teams have experienced a noticeable decline over the past two years. The Tech3 (now GASGAS) and RNF teams both are suited to being bottom of the grpah as we will se in the next section.

## 2022 Qualifying: Many close calls
